# Investigate_fuel_economy-
This is a case study in which I have analyzed fuel eco provided by Environmental Protection Agency.

The things i did are:
  1-Manipulating data and fixing more data type issues
  
  2-Evaluating merge types
  
  3-Visualizing data with more advanced tools
  
  4-Investigate a Dataset

What is Fuel Economy?

Excerpt from Wikipedia page on Fuel Economy in Automobiles:

The fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle.

Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed.

Q1: Are more unique models using alternative fuels in 2018 compared to 2008? By how much?
Q2: How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy (increased in mpg)?
Q3: What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they changed over time? (mpg, greenhouse gas)
Q4: What features are associated with better fuel economy (mpg)?
Q5: For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced now, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?

all of the required questions have been answered in visual in the python notebook
